# DeepML-Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the practice problems from [**Deep-ML**](https://www.deep-ml.com/)

## About Deep-ML

**Deep-ML** is a hands-on platform for machine learning and deep learning practice. It focuses on implementation, mathematical intuition, and applied problem-solving. The platform also has an active developer community for discussions, explanations, and shared insights. <br>

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as a personal collection of solutions as I work through Deep-ML challenges. The objectives are deliberate:

* Strengthen understanding through direct implementation
* Translate theory into working code
* Maintain a reference for review and iteration
* Identify and eliminate conceptual gaps

## Acknowledgments
* [**Deep-ML**](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems) for the Problems
* [DML-OpenProblem](https://github.com/Open-Deep-ML/DML-OpenProblem) and [Moe18](https://github.com/moe18) for building and maintaining the Deep-ML platform and its developer community
* Open-source libraries and documentation that support implementation and experimentation

### Disclaimer
These solutions are created for learning purposes. They are not guaranteed to be optimal or production-ready. Expect revisions as understanding deepens. This repository is a work in progress.
